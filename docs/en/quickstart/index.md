# Quickstart

Welcome to the syntax documentation of the mcfpp programming language. The document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the MCFPP language, covering its basic syntax, data types, control structures, function definitions, class definitions, MNI framework, and other important features. Click on the right navigation bar to start your MCFPP journey!

Some documents may be marked as TODO, don't worry, these are the features we haven't designed well yet! In the near future, we will supplement these contents.
